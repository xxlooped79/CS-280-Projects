/// This class serves the following purposes:
/// 1. In the first Monday, we will use this class to practice running Java and submitting work with git.
/// 2. In the first Wednesday, we will use this class as a model to understand how variables and objects are represented in memory.
/// 3. In the first weekend, we will learn how to adapt this class to use "generics".
/// 4. Later on, we will use this class to implement a *Map*, a data structure similar to Python's `dict`.

     * Construct a new ordered pair with the order of items reversed.

     * The ordered pair interface requires a method to transform an ordered pair (x,y) to its reverse, (y,x).
     * But there's a problem - for a KeyValuePair, x and y are two intrinsically different kinds of objects.
     * You can't just make a KeyValuePair with x and y reversed; that would be a - let's say - a ValueKeyPair!
     * 
     * Note that the ordered pair interface does not require us to return an ordered pair of the same type.
     * Any object implementing the `OrderedPair` interface will do.
     * So one solution would be to go through the effort of defining a `ValueKeyPair` class from scratch,
     * and for this `reversed` method to return an object of that class.
     * 
     * But this isn't a great solution, because a `ValueKeyPair` is not useful for anything other than this single method.
     * Instead, we can use an *anonymous class*,
     * defining a minimal custom behavior for a so-called ValueKeyPair from within the `reversed` method itself.
     * 
     * This design pattern is common whenever you need to implement a method which specifies an abstract return type.
     * We will see it again when we learn about iterators.
